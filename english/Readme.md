# WeProDev Academy
This repository outlines WeProDev's vision, mission, and guidelines for interns. It explains our expectations and provides resources to help interns grow and succeed.

# Mission & Vision
WeProDev's slogan, 'We develop for growth,' reflects our commitment to holistic development. We believe growth encompasses all aspects of human life, not just IT. Our goal is to create products that benefit our community and empower individuals to discover their unique paths and achieve their full potential. 

At WeProDev Academy, we strive to provide a supportive and nurturing environment where individuals can learn, grow, and develop the skills they need to succeed. We believe that **everyone has the potential to make a positive impact on the world**, and we are dedicated to helping our students realize their full potential.

# Our Process 
Successful WeProDev Academy applicants join a team to collaborate on an open-source project. 

This 3-5 month internship provides a hands-on opportunity to develop new skills within a supportive team environment.
After the Bootcamp, graduates will have 1:1 meetings to discuss CVs, LinkedIn profiles, and job search strategies.

# Policy & Rules

## Communication and Collaboration

- Interns in our program work together as a team and are always willing to lend a helping hand.
- To ensure effective collaboration, all project-related messages should be shared in the appropriate channels.
- Don't hesitate to reach out to a teammate for help. Let's chat online or via text!
- If you need assistance with a specific issue and don't know who to contact, post a question in the team chat.
- All group communication is in English, except for meetings where everyone speaks the same language fluently. For example, if everyone speaks Kurdish and Persian fluently, a meeting could be held in Persian or Kurdish.

## Diversity and Inclusion
- Humanity unites us all, transcending differences in race, age, gender, and ability.
